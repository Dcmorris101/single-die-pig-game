# single-die-pig-game

GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a die as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- If the player rolls 2 sixes in a row, their entire ROUND score and GLOBAL score are reset to 0.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach the manually entered points (or 100 by default) on GLOBAL score wins the game
